### ICIDS2023.pdf

This is a paper that ICT professor Andrew Gordon and I submitted for and was accepted into the 2023 International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS). We looked into the contemporary narrative capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 system. We had human testers interact with GPT-3.5 in a narrative card game called TellTale, where both the human testers and GPT-3.5 were asked to generate a story from a set of story cards and to evaluate each other's stories. Not only did this explore the narrative potential of GPT-3.5, it also explored its potential for interactive, game-like applications.

I was the primary writer and drafter for this paper. Professor Gordon provided invaluable suggestions, edits, and feedback, but essentially all of the words are mine.

### GPT TellTaleCards Player

This folder directly pertains to my ICIDS paper as described above. It contains the code for the website that human testers would use to interact with GPT-3.5 and play a game of TellTale cards. I used HTML and JavaScript for the front end, and I used Python and Flask for the back end to interact with the GPT API.

Note that the webiste won't actually work as it requires an OpenAI API key.

### NationalParkProject

This folder contains files for a website I completed as a final project for one of my classes at USC (ITP 303). This website allows a user to explore different national parks, create an account, save their favorite parks, and view where the park is in Google Maps. I used php and JavaScript for creating the website.

Note that some required pieces, such as the connection to an SQL database, is not included.

### Wang_Timothy_HW5 (Bonus)

I know that only two code samples were required, but I hope you don't mind if I include this too just to round out the Python code samples.

This folder contains a Python ipynb file for a machine learning assignment on decision trees for one of my classes at USC (DSCI 552). The homework uses SKLearn.

Please just let me know if you need any other, more recent ML Python examples/work that I've done -- I have ample other examples. (For instance, I have some scripts for solving multi-armed bandit RL problems and for solving Markov Decision Process problems.)
