### ICIDS2023.pdf

This is a paper that ICT professor Andrew Gordon and I submitted for and was accepted into the 2023 International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS). We looked into the contemporary narrative capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 system. We had human testers interact with GPT-3.5 in a narrative card game called TellTale, where both the humans and GPT-3.5 were asked to generate a story from a set of story cards and to evaluate each other's stories. Not only did this explore the narrative potential of GPT-3.5, it also explored its potential for interactive, game-like applications.

I was the primary writer and drafter for this paper. Professor Gordon provided invaluable suggestions, edits, and feedback, but essentially all of the words are mine.

### GPT TellTaleCards Player

This folder directly pertains to my ICIDS paper as described above. It contains the code for the website that human testers would use to interact with GPT-3.5 and play a game of TellTale cards. I used HTML and JavaScript for the front end, and I used Python and Flask for the back end to interact with the GPT API.

Note that the webiste won't actually work as it requires an OpenAI API key.
